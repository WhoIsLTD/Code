#generator is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method.
#When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning
#execution of the function. When the next() method is called for the first time, the function
#starts executing, until it reaches the yield statement, which returns the yielded value. The
#yield keeps track i.e. remembers the last execution and the second next() call continues
# from previous value.
