#Small Data - File
#Big and confidential - DB
#Very Big and confidental - Big DB...
#Data in programming and storing in a file permannet.
#File ---> Character textual information.
#Binary Format --> Image, Videos and Zip etc.

#File position, rename and deltion of file.
# file.close() -Close the file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more.
# file.flush() -Flush the internal buffer, like stdio's fflush. This may be a no-op on some file-like objects.
# file.isatty() - Returns True if the file is connected to a tty(-like) device, else False.
# next(file) - Returns the next line from the file each time it is being called.
# file.read([size]) - Reads at most size bytes from the file (less if the read hits EOF before obtaining size bytes).
# file.readline([size]) - Reads one entire line from the file. A trailing newline character is kept in the string.
# file.readlines([sizehint]) - Reads until EOF using readline() and return a list containing the lines. If the optional sizehint argument is present,
# instead of reading up to EOF, whole lines totalling approximately sizehint bytes (possibly after rounding up to an internal buffer size) are read.
# file.seek(offset[, whence]) - Sets the file's current position
# file.tell() - Returns the file's current position
# file.truncate([size]) - Truncates the file's size. If the optional size argument is present, the file is truncated to (at most) that size.
# file.write(str) - Writes a string to the file. There is no return value.
# file.writelines(sequence) - Writes a sequence of strings to the file. The sequence can be any iterable object producing strings, typically a list of strings.
